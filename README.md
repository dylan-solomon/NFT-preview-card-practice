## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The main thing I learned from this project was how to overlay an image on top of another image, and display it upon hover. I not only used opacity for the first time, I also was able to use a bit of a transition for the first time as well. I also continued expanding my knowledge of Flexbox, css selectors and positioning elements directly in the center of a page.
